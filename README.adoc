= Kernel Timer Stats

This small little kernel module and associated user application are there to 
collect statistics about the standard linux kernel timers and their real timeout.

== Build

Requirements:
- build-essentials, linux-headers-$(uname)
- kernel with enabled linux kernel module framework (e.g. insmod/rmmod)

To build enter the directory and invoke
[source, bash]
----
make
----

== Usage

Stay in the build directory and execute
[source, bash]
----
./run.sh > data.tsv
----

This script inserts the module, creates a device file (`/dev/lkm_timer_stats`) 
and then runs the application `app` for timer values from 1us to 500ms. It may take a while.
The result is stored in the file `data.tsv` or however you name it.

The output file is a tab separated list with one line for each timer value.
The desired timer value is given in column 0, then follow the real time intervals (512 samples).
All times are in microseconds.
